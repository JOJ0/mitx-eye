# The Eye Exercise

## Description

A self-study-exercise I solved during the [MITx Fullstack Programming Course](https://xpro.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:xPRO+PCCx/)

It's like XFree86'/X.org's [xeyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.Org_Foundation#xutils) only in the browser!


## How to Run

- [Clone the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
- Open index.html in your browser
- Push the buttons!

## Roadmap

Well, I guess there is no roadmap for this project.
